## Description üìù

Something that everyone encounters in their day-to-day is choosing what to wear. Sometimes it's as simple as throwing on your favorite hoodie and any decently clean pants and going about with your day. Other times, it's important to dress up a bit more. 

That's why I wanted to build this weather app. Because I live in Seattle, choosing the right clothes that feel good, makes me look good, and won't get ruined in the myriad of weather conditions we have up here is important.

Through this weather dashboard, it quickly lets me look up my city to see the current weather information along with the five day forecast! With the power of the OpenWeather API, the app displays the most accurate weather information possible.

## Learning Points ‚úçÔ∏è

One very important lesson learned during the creation of this app was the overall importance of using APIs as a way to enhance the user experience. 

As a developer, using APIs and third party libraries can be a lifesaver while creating an app. It would be incredibly arduous to parse through weather information as a general search query in Google and display that information the user. But thanks to the OpenWeather API, querying for the correct information and styling it by myself gives me more control in the user experience.

## API Call Example üìû

Below is an example of an API call I used in this app to get data for the current weather information for the users' queried city.

``` JavaScript
    fetch('https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat='+data.lat+'&lon='+data.lon+'&appid=4b8fc9e50a57f1de38a6a899538e2356&units=imperial')
    .then(function (r){
        if(r.ok){
            return r.json();
        }
    })
```
